# Association Football Player Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to identify top association football player prospects for two key positions: strikers and fullbacks. Utilizing data from a comprehensive dataset of male players, we employ various data analysis techniques to process, analyze, and visualize player statistics. Our goal is to find players who match specific criteria, including pace, workrate, and market value for strikers, and defensive attributes for young fullbacks.
